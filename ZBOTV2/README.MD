# ZBOT VERSION 2
This is second version of my own plugin. This one is written in a better way, so it is smaller (600+ lines, not 1100++), and more clean and way more optimised!.

## SETUP
In line 255 you can set your server ip and port, to have fast copy paste command for other players to join. I didn't make it get this values automaticaly because i didn't need that feel free to implement something like that. ðŸ˜€

### Chat Commands
Every command need to start from ! or . Ex. `!ready` or `.ready`
- During warmup (before match starts)
  - !ready \- Indicates that your team is ready to play
  - !unready \- Indicates that your team is not ready to play
- After knife round (available only for team that won knife round)
