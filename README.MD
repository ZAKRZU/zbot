# ZBOT
**Small plugin for Counter-Strike:Global Offensive server to automaticaly manage match settings, rules, status.**

## A little bit of history
I was playing CS:GO with my friends against teams that we found on IRC CHAT, and preparing server for new people was a little bit frustating, you need to manualy set options like, team names, maps, password, demo etc. To speed this up, i tried to use E-BOT, but I needed a place to hosted it, because i wanted it to be always functional even when I leave my home, their web-version had a lot of problems (ex. losing connection with our server). So I looked for some plugins, and I couldn't find anything worth it using. Another option was to make my own plugin, and I did it. I made 2 major versions. The first one was okay, it worked but the file was over 1100 lines long. And maintainig it was very painfull. So I decided to make second version. With more experience of Pawn language and SourceMod API, I made better version, that is easy to modify, and add new features.
